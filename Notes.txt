Notes:

This fork contains modifications made for my servers to add capability to save textures/colors for buildings and cars.
The scripts should work out of the box. 
 
Note that if you change anything and it does not work, there may be an error which you can detect by opening
the client .RPT which is stored in appdata\local\Arma3. Check there for any script errors.
